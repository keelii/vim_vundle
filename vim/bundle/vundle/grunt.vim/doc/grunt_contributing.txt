Contributing to grunt	*contributing-to-grunt-intro*

If you want to make contributions to grunt, by all means, please do so. "Patches welcome."


Discussing grunt	*contributing-to-grunt-discussing-grunt*

Join the [freenode](http://freenode.net/) #grunt IRC channel. We've got a bot and everything.


Filing issues	*contributing-to-grunt-filing-issues*

If something isn't working like you think it should, read the [API documentation](api.md). If it still isn't working like you think it should, [file an issue](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt/issues). If you'd like to chat directly, pop into IRC.


Cloning grunt	*contributing-to-grunt-cloning-grunt*

first, ensure that you have the latest [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/) installed.

Fork grunt in GitHub, and clone it locally:

>
	git clone git://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/grunt.git && cd grunt
<

To download grunt dependencies and add the development `grunt` bin script to your path:

>
	npm install && npm link
<


Reverting back to the &quot;live&quot; grunt	*contributing-to-grunt-reverting-back-to-the-live-grunt*

If, for some reason, you need to revert back to the current npm grunt release, just reinstall grunt globally via:

>
	npm install -g grunt
<


Actually contributing	*contributing-to-grunt-actually-contributing*

In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Fork, tweak, and make pull requests.. but `grunt` grunt first:

>
	grunt
<

_(you shouldn't see any red or yellow when you do this)_


One final note about contributing	*contributing-to-grunt-one-final-note-about-contributing*

I'll be completely up-front: while you know that your idea is well-reasoned and executed, I might need to be convinced of the value of incorporating it into grunt, because it might not be immediately apparent to me. Don't lose hope! All I ask is that you include, along with your pull request, an explanation of how your code is going to improve grunt. Thanks!
